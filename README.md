# sia-fluxlim
Implementation of a MUSCL flux limiter to a shallow ice approximation flow code based on finite differences.

For an overview of possible flux limiters to the MUSCL scheme, see [Wikipedia - flux limiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux_limiter). So far I have implemented the minmod, superbee and Koren flux limiters. As it turns out, the Koren flux limiter is the most accurate one of the three.

For more details such as the scientific argument as to why this is a good idea, please consult the acompaning publication by **A. H. Jarosch**, C. G. Schoof, and F. S. Anslow, "[Restoring mass conservation to shallow ice flow models over complex terrain](http://www.the-cryosphere.net/7/229/2013/tc-7-229-2013.html),‚Äù *The Cryosphere*, Vol. 7, Iss. 1, pp. 229-240, 2013.
